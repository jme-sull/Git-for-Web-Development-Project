Stretch Questions

 1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

	A inline element does not cause a line break, nor does it take up the entire width of the page, it is only bounded by its opening and closing tags. Examples include <a> and <img> 
 
	A block element always starts a new line and takes up the full width of the page, left to right. Examples include heading tag and lists. 


 2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

	When an element is positioned absolutely it is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor, or if there are no positioned ancestors, with the body of the document and moves along with scrolling 


3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

	You can set the element to a percentage of the page rather than a pretermeined pixel 	size. Then it will adjust with the window-size.
